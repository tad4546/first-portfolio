                    CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

                    Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.

                When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The browser displays the contents of the DOM.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id=" main section">
        <h2 id="about-dom">About the DOM</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.
            </p>
            <h3>
                DOM representation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's take an example to see how the DOM and CSS work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's assume the following HTML code:
            </p>
            <!--Note all code inside "textarea" is only for show in the web page, and not part of this-->
            <textarea readonly><p>
Let's use:
<span>Cascading</span>
<span>Style</span>
<span>Sheets</span>
</p>
            </textarea>
            <h3>
                Applying CSS to the DOM
            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the HTML is as follows:
            </p>
            <!--this is for what is inside the text boxes-->
            <textarea readonly><p>
Let's use: 
<span>Cascading</span>
<span>Style</span>
<span>Sheets</span>
</p>
            </textarea>
            <p>
                If we apply the following CSS to it:
            </p>
            <textarea readonly>span {
border: 1px solid black;
background-color: lime;
}               
            </textarea>
            <p>
                The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a span selector, it will apply that rule to each one of the three spans. The updated output is as follows:
            </p>
            <fieldset>
                <p>
                    Lets use: <span>Cascading</span> <span>Style</span> <span>Sheets</span>
                </p>
            </fieldset>

        <h2 id="apply-css-to-html">How to apply your CSS to your HTML</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, some more useful than others. Here we'll briefly review each one.
            </p>
            <h3>
                External stylesheet
            </h3>
            <p>
                You've already seen external stylesheets in this article, but not by that name. An external stylesheet is when you have your CSS written in a separate file with a ".css" extension, and you reference it from an HTML <button>< link ></button> element. The HTML file looks something like this:
            </p>
            <textarea readonly>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>My CSS experiment</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
    
    </html>
    
            </textarea>
            <p>
                And the CSS file:
            </p>
            <textarea readonly>
h1 {
    color: blue;
    background-color: yellow;
    border: 1px solid black;
    }
 p {
    color: red;
   }
            </textarea>
            <p>
                This method is arguably the best, as you can use one stylesheet to style multiple documents, and would only need to update the CSS in one place if changes were needed.
